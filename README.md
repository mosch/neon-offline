# Neon Offline
This example repository shows how to use the Neon library in an local / offline environment with docker. It runs 
a local postgres database and a local Neon (websockets) proxy.

## Using with Drizzle
This example uses Neon with the [Drizzle ORM](https://github.com/drizzle-team/drizzle-orm) but any other library should work the same.
I use this for offline / local development in a Cloudflare worker / Miniflare setup.
